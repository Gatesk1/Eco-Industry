	"description": "Energy shields (also known as energy barriers, reflective shields and simply shields) are a special type of electromagnetic fields.  The Energy Shield Generator is capable of forming a protective dome that dampens the impulses of energy weapons due to extremely dense and chaotic electromagnetic fields.  The creation of fields capable of splitting material projectiles has been theoretically substantiated; work is underway in this direction.",
